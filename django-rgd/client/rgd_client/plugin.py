        Search for geospatial entries based on various criteria.

        For Ranges (Tuples), an entry of `None` means that side of the range is unbounded.
        E.g. a range of (2, None) is 2 or more, (None, 5) is at most 5, (2, 5) is between 2 and 5.

        Args:
            query: Either a WKT GeoJSON representation, a GeoJSON string, or a GeoJSON dict.
            predicate: A named spatial predicate based on the DE-9IM. This spatial predicate will
                be used to filter data such that predicate(a, b) where b is the queried geometry.
            relates: Specify exactly how the queried geometry should relate to the data using a
                DE-9IM string code.
            distance: The min/max distance around the queried geometry in meters.
            acquired: The min/max date and time (ISO 8601) when data was acquired.
            instrumentation: The instrumentation used to acquire at least one of these data.
            limit: The maximum number of results to return.
            offset: The number of results to skip.

        Returns:
            A list of Spatial Entries.
